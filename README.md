# Assignment



The assignment consists of the following tasks:
1. Your TypeScript skills will be evaluated by your ability to transform one data structure into another
2. Your UI skills are evaluated by your ability to turn a very rough web page into something that looks like the supplied comp

The tasks has been designed to challenge even the most experienced frontend developer, and we do not expect anyone to produce
something 100% identical to the comp within the given timeframe.

We do however expect you to be able to produce something that works and looks nice and polished.

Your solution will be evaluated based on the quality of the produced code, as much as the finished result.

Aim towards producing production grade code, rather than maximising the amount of features.
